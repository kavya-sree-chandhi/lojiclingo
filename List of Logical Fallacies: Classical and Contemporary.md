# Comprehensive List of Logical Fallacies: Classical and Contemporary

## I. FORMAL FALLACIES
*Errors in logical structure that make arguments invalid regardless of content*

### A. Syllogistic Fallacies

#### **1. Undistributed Middle**
**Description**: The middle term in a syllogism is not distributed (doesn't refer to all members of a category).
**Example**: "All cats are animals. Lions are animals. Therefore, lions are cats."
**Why it fails**: The middle term "animals" doesn't cover all animals, creating an invalid connection.

#### **2. Affirming the Consequent**
**Description**: Assuming that if "if P then Q" is true, and Q is true, then P must be true.
**Example**: "If it's raining, the ground is wet. The ground is wet. Therefore, it's raining."
**Why it fails**: The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, snow melting, etc.).

#### **3. Denying the Antecedent**
**Description**: Assuming that if "if P then Q" is true, and P is false, then Q must be false.
**Example**: "If it's raining, I'll carry an umbrella. It's not raining. Therefore, I won't carry an umbrella."
**Why it fails**: You might carry an umbrella for other reasons (sun protection, fashion, etc.).

#### **4. Affirming a Disjunct (False Exclusionary Disjunct)**
**Description**: Assuming that if one part of an "either/or" statement is true, the other must be false.
**Example**: "Either John is home or he's at work. John is home. Therefore, he's not at work."
**Why it fails**: John could be working from home, making both conditions true.

#### **5. Fallacy of Four Terms (Quaternio Terminorum)**
**Description**: A syllogism appears to have three terms but actually has four due to ambiguous language.
**Example**: "All banks have vaults. The river has banks. Therefore, the river has vaults."
**Why it fails**: "Banks" means different things in each premise.

### B. Propositional Fallacies

#### **6. Masked-Man Fallacy**
**Description**: Assuming that if two terms refer to the same thing, they are interchangeable in all contexts.
**Example**: "Clark Kent is Superman. Lois Lane knows Clark Kent. Therefore, Lois Lane knows Superman."
**Why it fails**: Knowledge of identity is context-dependent.

#### **7. Sunk Cost Fallacy**
**Description**: Continuing a course of action because of previously invested resources rather than future value.
**Example**: "We've already spent $50,000 on this failing project, so we can't stop now."
**Why it fails**: Past costs are irrelevant to future decisions; only future costs and benefits matter.

## II. INFORMAL FALLACIES
*Arguments that are unsound due to issues with content, context, or reasoning approach*

### A. Fallacies of Relevance
*Premises that don't actually support the conclusion*

#### **8. Ad Hominem (Against the Person)**
**Description**: Attacking the person making an argument rather than the argument itself.
**Variants**:
- **Abusive**: Direct personal attack
- **Circumstantial**: Attack based on circumstances or motivations
- **Tu Quoque**: "You too" - pointing out hypocrisy

**Example**: "You can't trust Sarah's argument about climate change because she drives an SUV."
**Why it fails**: Personal characteristics don't affect argument validity.

#### **9. Ad Baculum (Appeal to Force)**
**Description**: Using threats or force to support a conclusion.
**Example**: "You better agree with my political views, or you'll lose your job."
**Why it fails**: Threats don't make claims true or false.

#### **10. Ad Populum (Appeal to the People/Bandwagon)**
**Description**: Arguing that something is true because many people believe it.
**Example**: "Most people believe in UFOs, so they must exist."
**Why it fails**: Popular belief doesn't determine truth.

#### **11. Ad Verecundiam (Appeal to Inappropriate Authority)**
**Description**: Citing an authority outside their area of expertise.
**Example**: "Einstein believed in God, so atheism is wrong."
**Why it fails**: Einstein's expertise was in physics, not theology.

#### **12. Ad Ignorantiam (Appeal to Ignorance)**
**Description**: Arguing that something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa.
**Example**: "No one has proven that aliens don't exist, so they must exist."
**Why it fails**: Lack of evidence against something doesn't prove it exists.

#### **13. Ad Misericordiam (Appeal to Pity)**
**Description**: Using emotional appeal to distract from logical reasoning.
**Example**: "I deserve a good grade because my dog died."
**Why it fails**: Emotional circumstances don't affect the quality of work or arguments.

#### **14. Red Herring**
**Description**: Introducing irrelevant information to distract from the main issue.
**Example**: "We shouldn't worry about pollution because unemployment is a bigger problem."
**Why it fails**: One problem doesn't negate the importance of addressing another.

#### **15. Straw Man**
**Description**: Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack.
**Example**: "Environmentalists want to shut down all industry and return to the Stone Age."
**Why it fails**: Attacks a distorted version rather than the actual position.

#### **16. Genetic Fallacy**
**Description**: Judging an argument based on its origin rather than its merit.
**Example**: "That idea came from a communist country, so it must be bad."
**Why it fails**: The source of an idea doesn't determine its truth value.

### B. Fallacies of Presumption
*Arguments that assume what they're trying to prove*

#### **17. Begging the Question (Circular Reasoning)**
**Description**: The conclusion is already assumed in the premises.
**Example**: "God exists because the Bible says so, and the Bible is true because it's the word of God."
**Why it fails**: Uses the conclusion as evidence for itself.

#### **18. Complex Question (Loaded Question)**
**Description**: A question that contains a controversial assumption.
**Example**: "Have you stopped beating your spouse?" (assumes you were beating them)
**Why it fails**: Forces acceptance of an unproven premise.

#### **19. False Dilemma (False Dichotomy)**
**Description**: Presenting only two options when more exist.
**Example**: "Either you're with us or against us."
**Why it fails**: Artificially limits options to create a binary choice.

#### **20. Hasty Generalization**
**Description**: Drawing broad conclusions from limited examples.
**Example**: "I met two rude people from that city, so everyone there must be rude."
**Why it fails**: Small sample size doesn't support broad generalizations.

#### **21. Accident (Dicto Simpliciter)**
**Description**: Applying a general rule to a specific case where it doesn't apply.
**Example**: "Killing is wrong, so we shouldn't kill cancer cells."
**Why it fails**: General rules may have exceptions in specific contexts.

#### **22. Converse Accident (Hasty Generalization)**
**Description**: Generalizing from exceptional cases.
**Example**: "Olympic athletes can run fast, so all humans can run fast."
**Why it fails**: Exceptional cases don't represent the general population.

### C. Fallacies of Ambiguity
*Arguments that depend on unclear or shifting meanings*

#### **23. Equivocation**
**Description**: Using the same word with different meanings in different parts of an argument.
**Example**: "The end of life is death. The end justifies the means. Therefore, death justifies the means."
**Why it fails**: "End" means different things in each usage.

#### **24. Amphiboly**
**Description**: Ambiguous grammar creates misleading impressions.
**Example**: "I saw the man with binoculars" (unclear who had the binoculars).
**Why it fails**: Grammatical ambiguity creates confusion about meaning.

#### **25. Composition**
**Description**: Assuming what's true of parts is true of the whole.
**Example**: "Each player on the team is excellent, so the team is excellent."
**Why it fails**: Parts having a quality doesn't guarantee the whole has it.

#### **26. Division**
**Description**: Assuming what's true of the whole is true of each part.
**Example**: "The orchestra plays beautifully, so each musician is excellent."
**Why it fails**: Collective properties don't necessarily apply to individuals.

#### **27. Accent**
**Description**: Changing meaning by emphasizing different words or phrases.
**Example**: "WE should not SPEAK ill of our friends" vs. "We should NOT speak ill of our friends."
**Why it fails**: Emphasis changes meaning without changing words.

### D. Causal Fallacies
*Errors in reasoning about cause and effect*

#### **28. Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (After This, Therefore Because of This)**
**Description**: Assuming that because B followed A, A caused B.
**Example**: "I wore my lucky socks and won the game, so the socks caused the victory."
**Why it fails**: Temporal sequence doesn't prove causation.

#### **29. Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (With This, Therefore Because of This)**
**Description**: Assuming correlation implies causation.
**Example**: "Ice cream sales and drowning deaths both increase in summer, so ice cream causes drowning."
**Why it fails**: Correlation can result from third factors (warm weather in this case).

#### **30. Regression Fallacy**
**Description**: Attributing regression to the mean to a specific cause.
**Example**: "I prayed for my sick child and they got better, so prayer healed them."
**Why it fails**: Many conditions naturally improve over time.

#### **31. Gambler's Fallacy**
**Description**: Believing that past random events affect future probabilities.
**Example**: "The coin has come up heads five times, so tails is due."
**Why it fails**: Each coin flip is independent of previous flips.

### E. Contemporary Digital Age Fallacies

#### **32. Algorithmic Bias Fallacy**
**Description**: Assuming algorithmic results are neutral and objective.
**Example**: "The search results show this is true because algorithms are unbiased."
**Why it fails**: Algorithms reflect the biases of their creators and training data.

#### **33. Digital Echo Chamber Fallacy**
**Description**: Believing information is true because it's widely shared in your online network.
**Example**: "Everyone in my feed is sharing this, so it must be accurate."
**Why it fails**: Social media algorithms create information bubbles that don't represent broader reality.

#### **34. Viral Truth Fallacy**
**Description**: Assuming viral content is accurate because of its popularity.
**Example**: "This video has millions of views, so it must be true."
**Why it fails**: Virality often depends on emotional appeal rather than accuracy.

#### **35. Screenshot Fallacy**
**Description**: Treating decontextualized screenshots as complete evidence.
**Example**: "This screenshot proves what they really think."
**Why it fails**: Screenshots can be edited, taken out of context, or lack important context.

#### **36. Platform Authority Fallacy**
**Description**: Assuming information is credible based on the platform it appears on.
**Example**: "It's on LinkedIn, so it must be professional and accurate."
**Why it fails**: Platforms don't verify content quality or accuracy.

#### **37. Engagement Metrics Fallacy**
**Description**: Judging content quality by likes, shares, or comments.
**Example**: "This post has thousands of likes, so the advice must be good."
**Why it fails**: Engagement metrics reflect emotional response, not accuracy or quality.

#### **38. Meme Logic Fallacy**
**Description**: Treating oversimplified memes as valid arguments.
**Example**: Using a cartoon meme to make complex political or scientific points.
**Why it fails**: Complex issues can't be accurately reduced to simple images and text.

#### **39. Deepfake Denial/Acceptance Fallacy**
**Description**: Either dismissing all digital evidence as potentially fake, or accepting it without verification.
**Example**: "It could be a deepfake" (dismissing valid evidence) or "I saw the video" (accepting without verification).
**Why it fails**: Requires case-by-case evaluation rather than blanket acceptance or rejection.

#### **40. AI Oracle Fallacy**
**Description**: Treating AI responses as authoritative and unbiased.
**Example**: "ChatGPT said this, so it must be correct."
**Why it fails**: AI systems have limitations, biases, and can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information.

## III. COGNITIVE BIAS-RELATED FALLACIES
*Fallacies that stem from systematic thinking errors*

#### **41. Confirmation Bias Fallacy**
**Description**: Only seeking information that confirms existing beliefs.
**Example**: Only reading news sources that align with your political views.
**Why it fails**: Selective information gathering doesn't lead to accurate understanding.

#### **42. Availability Heuristic Fallacy**
**Description**: Judging probability by how easily examples come to mind.
**Example**: "Shark attacks are common because I see them on the news often."
**Why it fails**: Media coverage doesn't reflect actual statistical frequency.

#### **43. Anchoring Fallacy**
**Description**: Over-relying on the first piece of information encountered.
**Example**: "The first price I saw was $100, so $80 seems like a good deal."
**Why it fails**: Initial information may be irrelevant or misleading.

#### **44. Dunning-Kruger Fallacy**
**Description**: Overconfidence in one's abilities due to lack of knowledge.
**Example**: "I read a few articles about vaccines, so I know better than doctors."
**Why it fails**: Limited knowledge often leads to overconfidence rather than appropriate humility.

#### **45. Survivorship Bias**
**Description**: Focusing on successful examples while ignoring failures.
**Example**: "Look at all these successful college dropouts - education isn't important."
**Why it fails**: Ignores the many unsuccessful dropouts and successful graduates.

## IV. SPECIALIZED DOMAIN FALLACIES

### A. Political and Social Fallacies

#### **46. False Flag Fallacy**
**Description**: Assuming that any convenient timing of events indicates deliberate manipulation.
**Example**: "This news broke right before the election, so it must be a political setup."
**Why it fails**: Coincidental timing doesn't prove conspiracy.

#### **47. Whataboutism (Tu Quoque)**
**Description**: Deflecting criticism by pointing to others' similar behavior.
**Example**: "You can't criticize our corruption - your party is corrupt too."
**Why it fails**: Others' wrongdoing doesn't excuse your own.

#### **48. Tokenism Fallacy**
**Description**: Using isolated examples to deny systemic issues.
**Example**: "We have one female CEO, so there's no gender discrimination."
**Why it fails**: Exceptions don't disprove patterns or systemic issues.

#### **49. Just-World Fallacy**
**Description**: Assuming that people get what they deserve.
**Example**: "They must have done something wrong to be in that situation."
**Why it fails**: Many factors beyond personal behavior affect outcomes.

### B. Scientific and Technical Fallacies

#### **50. Naturalistic Fallacy**
**Description**: Assuming that what is natural is automatically good or right.
**Example**: "Herbal remedies are natural, so they must be safer than synthetic drugs."
**Why it fails**: Natural doesn't necessarily mean safe or effective.

#### **51. Appeal to Ancient Wisdom**
**Description**: Assuming old beliefs are more valid than new knowledge.
**Example**: "Traditional medicine has been used for thousands of years, so it must work."
**Why it fails**: Age doesn't validate effectiveness; many old beliefs have been disproven.

#### **52. Reification (Hypostatization)**
**Description**: Treating abstract concepts as if they were concrete things.
**Example**: "The economy wants lower taxes" (treating economy as a person with desires).
**Why it fails**: Abstract concepts don't have agency or intentions.

#### **53. Correlation Without Causation**
**Description**: Modern version emphasizing data misinterpretation.
**Example**: "Countries with more storks have higher birth rates, so storks bring babies."
**Why it fails**: Correlation may be coincidental or due to third factors.

### C. Media and Information Fallacies

#### **54. False Balance**
**Description**: Presenting all sides as equally valid when evidence strongly supports one side.
**Example**: Giving equal time to climate scientists and climate deniers.
**Why it fails**: Not all viewpoints are equally supported by evidence.

#### **55. Clickbait Fallacy**
**Description**: Judging content quality by headline sensationalism.
**Example**: "You Won't Believe What Happened Next!" style headlines.
**Why it fails**: Sensational headlines often exaggerate or misrepresent content.

#### **56. Source Credibility Fallacy**
**Description**: Accepting or rejecting information based solely on source reputation rather than evaluating the specific claim.
**Example**: "The New York Times said it, so it must be true" or "Fox News said it, so it must be false."
**Why it fails**: Even credible sources can make errors; each claim should be evaluated independently.

## V. METACOGNITIVE AND PHILOSOPHICAL FALLACIES

#### **57. Fallacy Fallacy**
**Description**: Assuming that because an argument contains a fallacy, its conclusion must be false.
**Example**: "You used an ad hominem attack, so your conclusion about climate change is wrong."
**Why it fails**: Bad arguments can still have true conclusions.

#### **58. Middle Ground Fallacy**
**Description**: Assuming the truth lies somewhere between two opposing positions.
**Example**: "Some say the Earth is flat, others say it's round, so the truth must be somewhere in between."
**Why it fails**: Sometimes one side is simply correct and the other is wrong.

#### **59. Nirvana Fallacy (Perfect Solution Fallacy)**
**Description**: Rejecting good solutions because they're not perfect.
**Example**: "This renewable energy plan won't solve all environmental problems, so we shouldn't implement it."
**Why it fails**: Improvement is valuable even if it's not complete.

#### **60. Moving the Goalposts**
**Description**: Changing the criteria for success when initial criteria are met.
**Example**: "First you said I needed a college degree for this job, now you say I need experience too."
**Why it fails**: Changing standards retroactively is unfair and prevents resolution.

## Usage Guidelines for Anti-Fallacy Training

### **Recognition Difficulty Levels**:
1. **Beginner**: Clear, obvious examples (Red Herring, Ad Hominem)
2. **Intermediate**: Context-dependent fallacies (Appeal to Authority, False Dilemma)
3. **Advanced**: Subtle or debatable cases (Naturalistic Fallacy, False Balance)
4. **Expert**: Edge cases and cultural variations

### **Teaching Sequence Recommendations**:
1. Start with formal fallacies for logical structure understanding
2. Progress to clear relevance fallacies
3. Introduce ambiguity and presumption fallacies
4. Address cognitive bias-related fallacies
5. Explore contemporary digital-age fallacies
6. Practice with domain-specific fallacies relevant to user interests

### **Context Considerations**:
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Some fallacies may appear differently across cultures
- **Domain Specificity**: Scientific fallacies require different context than political ones
- **Contemporary Relevance**: Digital age fallacies are increasingly important
- **Nuance Recognition**: Many fallacies are context-dependent rather than absolute

This comprehensive list provides the foundation for a robust anti-fallacy training system that can adapt to users' skill levels and interests while maintaining relevance to contemporary discourse challenges.
